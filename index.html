									<h3><a >Skylines on MapReduce framework (Aug 2015 – Nov 2015) </a></h3>			
									The aim of the project was to explore the field of adapting skyline computations on a mapreduce framework.
									1. A hadoop cluster using a master-slave architecture with 3 physical slave nodes was set up to implement the various algorithms and evaluate their performances along with benchmarking the performances of these algorithms on our Hadoop distributed file system.
									
									2. The map-reduce paradigm proposed by Dean and Ghemawat in 2008 forms the crux of the algorithms that we have used.
									
									3. Algorithms like BNL, SFS and Bitmap were adapted to the mapreduce framework. Also, partitioning using angular partitions instead of grids was used to ensure each mapper instance getting some skyline nodes.

									<h3><a >Catalogue Builder (May 2015 – Jul 2015) </a></h3>			
									Worked as an Intern in Seller Registration and Engagement Team at Amazon,Bangalore.

									1. The Catalog Builder provides Seller with UI for getting his product data exported into excel file as per amazon style guidelines.
									
									2. Seller will be able to create a complete feed with variations. Seller can also upload a raw file and get it converted in amazon format and can manually enter data,validate the data and see the errors in the UI.
									
									3. Seller can correct the data and regenerate the file, can also see the instructions and examples of all the attributes and can delete or duplicate some data.

									<h3><a >Tetris 3-D (Aug 2014 – Nov 2014) </a></h3>
									The aim of the project was to add an extra dimension to the traditional game of Tetris and implement it using C++ , OpenGL and OpenAL.
									1. Designed a Heads-up Display (HUD) - the HUD will display the current player score, game title and a side window displaying the next block.
									2. Implemented texture mapping for the blocks.
									3. Used ambient lights and particle effects to add visual appeal and added sound effects to game.

									<h3><a >Video Surveillance (May 2014 - Nov 2014) </a></h3>
									Implemented Image Processing on Video Surveillance of IIT Kanpur . The aim of the project was to detect the number plates on every moving object and categorize them . The unwanted frames were removed by separating foreground from background using Method of Gaussians in OpenCV (Implemented the algorithm for an improved adaptive background mixture model for real-time tracking with shadow detection).
									1. Studied various methods for background subtraction and motion detection (optical flow) for selecting candidate frames that contain useful data in the surveillance video.
									2. Implemented a real-time system for adaptive background subtraction using Gaussian Mixture Model
									3. Implemented Viola-Jones object detection framework for vehicle classification using OpenCV
									4. Extracted candidate license plate areas from the images and enhanced those using morphological operations as a first step towards Optical Character Recognition.
									5. Improved the background subtraction to work better in large illumination and weather changes

									<1. Worked at a start up jutja.com, a project management website with mind-mapping tasks.
									2. Designed the user interface of the website and was the front-end developer of the website.
									3. Implemented the mind-mapped visualization of tasks using Vivagraph library in JavaScript.
									4. The website uses single-page interface to avoid reloading of webpage.

									<h3><a > Compiler Design (Jan 2014 – Apr 2014) </a></h3>
									<p>
										Compiler: We will build a cross compiler with the source language as Java, Target Language as MIPS and implementation language as Python.
										Lexer : We have a made a lexer for the source language JAVA . The output of the program is a tagged program, with the token types appearing as comments.
										Parser: Then from the above, we have made a parser and the output is a parse tree of the input program in dot format(that can be rendered using graphviz)
										Intermediate Code Generator: Here, we wrote a Intermediate Code Generator(in Ass3 folder) for the source language JAVA. The output for it is a linked list of Three Address Code(3AC). So, we designed the 3AC code, attached semantic rules to the grammar designed in "Compiler-parser" repository to generate a three-address code for JAVA language as a linked-list of three-address statements and print the 3-address code on the standard output.
										Assembly Code Generator: Here, we then wrote an Assembly Code Generator from the above INtermediate Code Generator. The output of this is assembly code in MIPS. Here , we have implemented a register allocator,implement the translator to translate statements in three-address code to assembly instruction, set up the data regions to handle global data and constants, and provided some of the library support for useful programs.

									<h3><a href="https://github.com/luckysahani/Mail-Classifier-2">Content Based Email Classifier (May 2013 – Jul 2013)</a></h3>
									Studied and Implemented various Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms like SVM, Forest Tree, Naive Bayes etc. to classify Emails into pre-defined categories based on their content.
									1. The project involved creating a mail classier based on bag of words model using publicly available Enron mail database.
									2. Aimed at building an automatic categorising routine using the classier.
									3. Studied and implemented various supervised learning algorithms like Multiclass-SVM, Naive Bayes, Random forests. Also used basic natural language processing techniques like POS-tagging, stemming and separating word clusters.
									4. Achieved an accuracy of upto 80% on balanced datasets but due to high variance observed in such tasks accuracy down to 45% was also observed on some datasets.
									5. The main testing and classication module was built using python, python-nltk, scikit-learn, weka. A prototype for Gmail was also built using Google App script.

									<h3><a >Hexxagon ( Jul 2012 – Oct 2012 )</a></h3>
									<p> The aim of this project was to implement a game Hexxagon (http://www.miniclip.com/games/hexxagon/en/). The game is developed in python using pygame module and runs fine on a linux platform. One can play it as a 2 player game as well as one player Vs AI. Two AI players labeled as easy and hard are developed for the same purpose</p>
